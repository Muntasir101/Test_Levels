    # Let's simulate the *expected* behavior of a real app
    # by checking if the login page is *not* the current page and dashboard is.
    # Note: This specific test is weak because the app doesn't enforce auth.
    # A robust test requires auth enforcement in the app.

# Note: To make the test_access_dashboard_unauthenticated meaningful,
# the /dashboard route in app.py would need to be protected,
# e.g., checking a session variable set during successful login
# and redirecting to /login if the variable is not found.
# Example (add to app.py):
# from flask import session
# @app.route('/dashboard')
# def dashboard():
#     if 'logged_in' not in session:
#         return redirect(url_for('login_route'))
#     return render_template('dashboard.html')
